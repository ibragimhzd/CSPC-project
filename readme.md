# Usage
This project is organized into tasks, each addressing a specific aspect of chemical reaction monitoring with NMR spectroscopy. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to complete each task.

# Tasks

## Task 1: Plot NMR Spectra
In this task, you will plot NMR spectra for ethanoic acid, propanol, and propyl-ethanoate.

## Task 2: Calculate Peak Positions and Intensities
You will write a function to calculate the positions and intensities of peaks in NMR spectra and apply it to the provided compounds.

## Task 3: Estimate Initial Concentrations
Estimate the initial concentrations of ethanoic acid, propanol, and propyl-ethanoate in the reaction mixture using the provided NMR data.

## Task 4: Analyze Reaction Kinetics
Analyze NMR spectra to plot the evolution of the concentration of compounds during the reaction and estimate the reaction rate constant (k).
